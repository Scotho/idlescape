/**
 * Accumulated chat history for the SDK.
 *
 * The client keeps a 100-deep chat ring and the bot page snapshots the 50 most
 * recent messages into every state sync (~1 per server tick). Reading only the
 * latest snapshot means anything older than 50 messages is gone — a busy grind
 * session evicts a teammate's instructions in under a minute. This class merges
 * each snapshot into a persistent, deduplicated buffer so the SDK retains the
 * last {@link CHAT_HISTORY_LIMIT} messages seen since connect, regardless of
 * how fast the client ring churns.
 *
 * Merging prefers `observationId`, the monotonic state-publication revision
 * when a message first became agent-visible. Older clients fall back to
 * `tick`. A lower cursor means the browser page reloaded with a fresh ring.
